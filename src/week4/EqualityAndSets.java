//Brush up on your biology and place the following in the proper hierarchy: Dog, Reptile, Animal, Mammal

//Lets practice Equality
//As a reference, use the slide deck from Equality and Sets from yesterday
//mkdir computer-equality
//build in junit test dependency
//create a Computer class with make, model and price
//let's run the following tests:
//run a test that 2 computer objects are Aliases of one another
//run a test that object equals is being utilized correctly
//run a test to assert that object equals is overridden by the Computer class (slide 6-8 will help!)
