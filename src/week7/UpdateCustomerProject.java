//Let's add some queries to the customers-jpa project and update our CustomerController to see these changes happen in our application
//
//Remove the commenting from CustomerPopulator ... at least so that the database is available during run time
//Run your application to make sure the names are properly showing when navigating to localhost:8080/customers
//In CustomerController allow for requests to be made to localhost:8080 that would show all names in the database
//In CustomerController display all of the people with the last name of "Bauer" when navigating to localhost:8080/bauer
//Update the CustomerRepository with the following query: Collection<Customer> findAll(Sort sort);
//In CustomerController allow for requests to be made to localhost:8080/customers-sorted to display a sorted list of the database
//Navigate to localhost:8080/h2-console and connect to the default in memory database...add a record and refresh the customers-sorted page...notice what happens
